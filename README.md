## Requirements

- React Native
- Npm or Yarn
- Expo
- Android Studio or a Mobile Phone with Expo Go (android)

## Main dependencies

The **most relevant dependencies** I used during the development of the application were:

 - Platzi Fake Store API: used to create users and authenticate them at login, and also manage an ecommerce
   
 - Styled-components: I used it to create custom components
   
  - React Native Svg and React Native Svg Transformer: used to configure
   the application so that it can read Svg files and use them as a
   component.
   
  - Yup: used to validate inputs such as minimum password length,
   required fields, correct email formatting, etc.
   
  - React Hook Form: used to perform form validations

  - Jest: for unit tests

 1. To use **Android Studio** (I assume you have already installed and configured Android Studio. If necessary, use this link to help you install/configure Android Studio [Windows | Rocketseat Docs](https://react-native.rocketseat.dev/android/windows)), press the key `a`
2. To use a **mobile device**, install the Expo Go app on the device and open the app
	- In the option "***Enter URL manually***" you can type the link that is in your terminal, in the example above it would be `exp://192.168.3.25:8081`.

	- In the "***Scan QR code***" option you can scan the QR code on the terminal.
